# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-using-PowerBI
## Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to extract valuable insights that support data-driven decision-making for the hospitality industry.
I worked with a dataset containing 5,000+ rows of booking records and created a variety of visualizations and metrics to understand booking trends, customer behavior, and performance indicators.

## Key Visualizations
Line Chart – Booking trends over time,  
Bar Charts – Bookings by channel and day of the week,  
Donut Chart – Difference between booking date and check-in date,  
Matrix Table – Breakdown by customer segments,  
Pie Chart – Booking vs. Cancellation distribution,  
KPI Cards – Key figures like Total Revenue, Booking Count, Avg. Room Rate, 
Slicers – Interactive filters for dates and other attributes.  
## DAX Measures Used
Total Bookings,  
Total Revenue,  
Average Room Rate,  
Cancellation Percentage.  
These metrics were calculated using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to add dynamic, calculated insights to the dashboard.  
## Key Learnings
Hands-on experience building end-to-end dashboards in Power BI,  
Writing custom DAX formulas for KPIs,  
Applying data cleaning and transformation techniques,  
Improving visual storytelling and user interaction in dashboards.
